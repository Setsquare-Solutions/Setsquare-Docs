# Pages, News & Events

## List View

These three categories of content are managed in a similar way to each other with some minor differences between the three.

When you first click on the link to one of these pieces of content in the sidebar menu, you will be taken to the list view for that content. This view shows a list of all existing content of that type along with a button to create new content.

To create new content simply click the "Create New" button in the top left of the page. You will be taken to a new editor with some placeholder values. The editor view will be explained in the next section.

Below the create button is the search bar. You can search by content name, url, page content or author.

On the right side of the page is the list of current content organised in alphabetical order. You will see the name and url of the content, date it was created, eye icon to represent visibility (open for visible, slashed for hidden). Finally is an edit or delete button. 

Click the edit button to be taken to the editor for that page or delete to permanently delete it. You will be asked to confirm your deletion for safety.
