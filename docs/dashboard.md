# Getting Started

## Dashboard

The first page you will be presented with is the Dashboard. This page gives a brief overview of the most recently edited content along with a list of recent successful and failed user logins.

The recent content edits are grouped by type (Page, News, Event, Meetings) and will show up to the 5 most recent edits in each group, along with the date and time of the amendment.

Clicking on the content name will take you into the editor for that content and allow further amendments to be made.

The recent logins section is grouped by most recent successful login and most recent failed login for each user. This is simply provided as a security audit to help identify potentially suspicious login patterns, or to detect struggling users who may need assistance.
