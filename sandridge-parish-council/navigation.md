# Navigation

The navigation page is where you will set which pages and links appear within the main navigation bar along the top of the website, as well as the links that appear in the footer. 

You can select which navigation you are editing by using the dropdown at the top of the page.

## Adding an Item

After selecting the menu you want to edit, you can add new pages using the form on the left. 

You are able to choose an existing page from the drop down, which will automatically populate the correct details.You are also able to type in custom  values, for example if you want to link to a third party website.

* Name - the name that will appear in the menu, does not need to match the actual page name.
* URL - the link to the website, either copy this from the page you want to add or add the full url for a third party website. e.g. https://google.com
* Parent - this page that this page will appear below. No parent will be added to the top bar, otherwise the page will be added into the dropdown menu of the parent page.
* Visible - whether the page is visible in the menu or not. Setting this to NO can be useful if you want to temporarily hide a page, or if it is still under construction.
* Open in - for internal links choose Current Window, for third party links choose New Window.

## Updating Existing Structure

On the right side of the page is the current navigation structure. This can be amended by dragging and dropping items. 

Click and hold the six dots next to an item to drag it elsewhere in the menu. You can also click the dots of multiple items to turn them red, and move all items in one go.

The eye icon represents if the item is visible, with a slashed eye representing hidden.

Click the red bin button to delete an item, or the blue pen button to edit the item. When editing a window will pop-up, make your changes and then close the window. You will see a spinning icon appear next to that item to show that there are pending changes. 

After re-ordering the menu and making any edits or deletions, scroll to the very bottom of the page and click the Save Structure button.
