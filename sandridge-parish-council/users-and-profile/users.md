# Users - Users & Profile

The users page is where you will create other accounts that have access to the CMS to manage the website. 

On the left is a form to create a new user. Set a first and last name for them, enter their email address and two matching passwords. Finally select a role. The default Admin role provides access to everything, though other custom roles can be created.

Below the form is a search bar, you can search by name, email or username.

The role will appear in the list below, where you can click the manage button to choose what pages this role has access to in the pop-up window.

In the pop-up hold the CTRL key on the keyboard and click on the pages that you want this role to have access to. You can also CTRL+click a selected page to 
deselect it. Click the Save role button when done.

It is also possible to delete roles from the pop-up, any user who was set to that role will become a full admin after it is deleted.
