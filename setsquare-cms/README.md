# Getting Started

## Quick Overview

This documentation has been broken down into each major section of the CMS. 

In many cases each page of the CMS has multiple views. Usually a list view which contains an overview of all individual items within that section, and allows you to create additional items.

There is also a single view which is where you will edit those individual items.

Some pages in the CMS contain additional views which contain information relevant to that type of content.

## General Documentation

This documentation has been provided for the base version of the CMS. 

The CMS is tailored to each clients specific needs. As such this documentation may not be an exact representation of your system. 

It will not cover any custom or bespoke features that have been created for your needs. Some base features may also be reconfigured depending on your needs, so page layouts or text may not be accurate.
